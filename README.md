**What is This?**
One line to get and listen to the podcasts you want. 

**Why?**
Bloated overly feature stuffed apps with restrictive eulas and walled garden methodologies break some of what made Podcasts the joy they were always meant to be. The Podcasting method was created to make it easier to get the audio offerings you wanted to hear and to offer up your audio creations to a wider audience. 

Get the app out of the way, grab the goods and listen. **BishBashBosh**....done.
